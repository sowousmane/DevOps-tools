This is a configuration snippet written in YAML format for a Docker service, specifically for setting up Prometheus, a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. Let's break down what each part of the configuration does:

### Service Name and Image
```yaml
prometheus:
  image: prom/prometheus:v2.47.1
```
- `prometheus` is the name of the service.
- `image: prom/prometheus:v2.47.1` specifies the Docker image to be used, which is `prom/prometheus` with version `v2.47.1`.

### Volume Mounts
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./prometheus/:/etc/prometheus/
  - prometheus_data:/prometheus
```
- Mounts the local `./prometheus/` directory into the container at `/etc/prometheus/`.
- Uses a named volume called `prometheus_data` and mounts it into the container at `/prometheus`.

### Prometheus Configuration
```yaml
command:
  - "--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
  - "--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus"
  - "--web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries"
  - "--web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles"
```
- Specifies command-line arguments to configure Prometheus.
- `--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` sets the path to the configuration file inside the container.
- `--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus` sets the storage path for the Time Series Database (TSDB).
- `--web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries` and `--web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles` configure the paths for web console libraries and templates respectively.

### Network and Port Configuration
```yaml
ports:
  - 9091:9090
```
- Maps port `9091` on the host to port `9090` in the container, allowing external access to Prometheus on port `9091`.

### Environment Variables
```yaml
environment:
  - VIRTUAL_HOST=prometheus.soowcode.local
  - VIRTUAL_PORT=9090
```
- Sets environment variables for the service.
- `VIRTUAL_HOST=prometheus.soowcode.local` specifies the virtual host for routing requests to the service.
- `VIRTUAL_PORT=9090` specifies the virtual port for routing requests to the service.

### Dependencies
```yaml
depends_on:
  - cadvisor
```
- Specifies that this service depends on another service named `cadvisor`. Docker Compose will start `cadvisor` before starting `prometheus`.

### Networks and Extra Hosts
```yaml
networks:
  - proxy_my-network
  - default
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```
- Adds the service to two networks: `proxy_my-network` and the default network.
- Configures an extra host entry mapping `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway`, allowing the service to access the host's network namespace.

This configuration snippet defines a Prometheus service with specific settings for volumes, configuration, ports, environment variables, dependencies, and networking. It's a part of a larger Docker Compose configuration defining multiple services and their interactions within a Dockerized application.
